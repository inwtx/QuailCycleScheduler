This program can be used to keep track of a 75 day Coturnix quail cycle.  It can be formatted for raising other types of quail for a 75 day period.  The program covers the incubating, brooding, and grow-out periods.  Date can be highlighted with up to 9 colors.  Clicking on the day number under a highlighted date will display a message corresponding to the color.  Messages can also be posted on given days at program start and throughout any chosen days.
