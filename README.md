The program covers the incubating, brooding, grow-out, and an additional 5 days for mature incubator egg collection periods.  Date can be highlighted with up to 9 colors.  Clicking on the day number under a highlighted date will display a message corresponding to the color.  Messages can also be posted on given days at program start and throughout any chosen days.
